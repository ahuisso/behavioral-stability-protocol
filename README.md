# Behavioral Stability Protocol (BSP)
A logic-first architectural framework for human financial systems
## Overview
The Behavioral Stability Protocol (BSP) is a logic-first architectural framework designed to stabilize human financial systems during periods of high cognitive load and systemic stress. 

Unlike traditional "advice," the BSP functions as a **systemic guardrail**, removing emotional variables from the decision-making loop to ensure long-term solvency and operational continuity.

## The Core Methodology: "Logic-First"
This protocol was developed through a 10-day adversarial design sprint. To ensure resilience, the framework was subjected to simulated "behavioral breaches" using LLM-based adversarial agents to identify edge-case failures in human judgment.

### Protocol Phases
* **Phase 0: Baseline Hardening** – Establishing the Minimum Survival Buffer (MSB).
* **Phase 1: Controlled Execution** – Eliminating automation until manual stability is verified.
* **Phase 2: The Stability Window** – A 30-day "lock" on high-risk variables to prevent state-decay.
